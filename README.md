# NYC-Citibike-Data-Analysis-on-Tableau
This is a Tableau project that examinesthe impact of the CoviD-19 pandemic on  New York City's bicycle renting program in pursuit of making recommendations about real-life phenoomena, and decisions. Check out the final result [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alexei.flores#!/vizhome/CoviDimpactonNYCCitibikeProgram_16155866797150/Story1?publish=yes)
## Tableau
Tableau is a pouplar software for creating dashboards that visualize data; and for effective storytelling with that data. It provides an easy-to-use tool for making quickcharts analysesand aggregations; ad for turning data  into intuitive plots and the like. A [public Tableau profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alexei.flores#!/) is also a good place to showcase and host a data analyst's work. 
## The Impact of the CoviD-19 Pandemic on New York City's Citibike program
This Tableau project aims to look at NYC Citibike [data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) to see how the onset of the 2020 pandemic affected the bicycle program through the first half of 2020. Per the Citibike [site](https://www.citibikenyc.com/about), the program took 6 years to log its 50 millionth trip in October 2017; but easily doubled that milestone to 100 million by July 2020
## Uneven utilization of Citibike bicycles
There are two ways to conceive of utlization for this dataset. One is to tal number of triips a bike unit has been taken on. However, a more appropriate metric might be the total trip duration each bicycle has accrued over its life in the program. Bassed on this metric, there is a massive assymetry in how much some bicycles are used compred to others. In the plots below, the most utilized bicycle unithas seen more seconds of usage in total than the the combined total trip durations of the 900th to 1000th most utilized units.  
## Citibike User Habits changed in response to the pandemic
While subscribers have probably been behaving differently than customer users, the March 2020 lockdown effected different changes for each type of user. In general, program usage 
appears to have dipped slightly in April due to the March 22 lockdown. However, the April dip appears little more than a shallow obstacle when contrasted with the program's consistent growth through the following months. Moreover, cutomer and subscriber usage, which were already different before the pandemic, diverged even more during the lockdown period. Subscriber trips drove the increase in the number of trips during the first half of 2020; while customer trips led to an increase in the total, and average monthly trip durationsduring the period. 

This data suggests a prefence for frequent short trips among subscribers. 

This differential pattern paints the different incentives brought about by different pricing schemes for both user types: Subscribers who are more likely to be localls who pay a fixed fee pay their subscription fee regardless of whther they actually ride an NYC Citibike or not. Hence, their maximization incentive is to take as many trips as possible, regardless of length.
